For my project, I was inspired by simple, routinely tasks, like riding public transportation or buying groceries. During these times when lifestyle routines are uprooted, I feel a greater appreciation for the common and everyday errands. I realized that although tasks like these are ordinary, there is a certain calmness and enjoyableness in their consistency and simplicity that I found myself really missing. I wanted to recreate these tasks and focus on their subtle beauty with my three drawings. The first drawing is of a fruit market, where the user can grocery shop by picking up the fruits and placing them in their basket. This drawing is the most user interactive. The second drawing gives the experience of taking a public transportation bus. I will incorporate video and mix blend modes to create an immersive experience of the busâ€™s movement and the serenity of seeing out the bus windows. The third drawing is of walking back home, along a street of other people doing just the same. I will compile multiple images of the same silhouette of the middle of a street with buildings and people on each side. These images will fade in and out of each other.
